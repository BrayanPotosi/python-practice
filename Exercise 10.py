# Exercise 10

# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5),
# except require the solution in a different way.
#
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
# Write this in one line of Python using at least one list comprehension.
# (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python,
# but a few readers pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets
# that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can either choose to use the original directive and read
# about the set command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this on your own and use
# at least one list comprehension in the solution.

# Extra:
#
# Randomly generate two lists to test this

    # random_list(8, 10, list_two)
