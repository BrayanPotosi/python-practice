#Exercise 26

# This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

# As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. However, 
# this is significantly more than half an hour of coding, so weâ€™re doing it in pieces.

# Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, not worrying about how the moves were made.

# If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

# game =  [[1, 2, 0],
#	      [2, 1, 0],
#	     [2, 1, 1]]
